**IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance**

**Business Problem**
Attrition is a problem that impacts all businesses, irrespective of geography, industry and size of the company. Employee attrition leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff. As such, there is great business interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition.
This data set presents an employee survey from IBM, indicating if there is attrition or not. The data set contains approximately 1500 entries. While some level of attrition in a company is inevitable, minimizing it and being prepared for the cases that cannot be helped will significantly help improve the operations of most businesses. This could generate new insights for the business on what drives attrition, insights that cannot be generated by merely informational interviews with employees.

After giving a total overview of the whole dataset and business problem, let’s delve into the purpose of this analysis. 



**DASHBOARD OVERVIEW**
Title, Education (used as filter), KPIs, Attrition rate by departments, Number of employees by age group, Job satisfaction rating, Education field by attrition, Attrition rate by gender for different age group. 
DESIGNING THE KPIs
Overall employees
Attrition
Attrition rate
Active employees
Average age
Overall employees
This KPI addresses the total number of employees in the dataset. Overall employee is the sum of employee_count.
Attrition
Attrition is the term used to describe employee leaving the company and it was represented as (0=No, 1=Yes). But for clarity of this analysis, a formula was used to covert the numerical value of attrition field to YES/NO.

Attrition rate
Attrition rate describes the number of people that left the company in relation to total employee. This value is expressed in percentage (%). A new measure was created and title Attrition rate.
Attrition Rate = SUM ('HR data'[Attrition Count])/SUM ('HR data'[Employee Count])

Active employees
Active employees refer to the total number of employees that are still part of the company. This is calculated by calculating the difference between the total employee and the number of employees that left the company.
Active Employees = SUM('HR data'[Employee Count])-SUM('HR data'[Attrition Count])

Average age
Average age refers to summation of all age field divided by the count of age. Powerbi has a custom calculation for average and that was used for this Average age KPI. While dragging in age in the data field, there is a dropdown arrow to choose what you wish to express the field as such as sum, average, median etc… 

Attrition rate by departments
Rate at which staff are leaving the company in each department. A total of three (3) departments are addressed in this dataset namely: R&D, HR and Sales. 
Pie-chart was used to visualize this business problem. Under legend (Department) and values (sum of attrition) count was used. The result of this visualization shows that out of the 3 departments, R&D department had over 50% attrition rate (56.12%, 133), next is Sales with (38.82%, 92) attrition rate, and the least was recorded for HR with (5.06%, 12) attrition rate. 

Number of employees per age group
In order to have more insights on age of the employees in his dataset, a column named Age group was created by writing the formula below. Age were grouped into: Under 25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54 and over 55. 

For the visualization, a stacked column chart was used. The visualization revealed that 25-34 age group had the highest number of employee with a total of 554 (337 male and 217 female), followed by 35-44 with a total of 505 (309 male and 196 female), next is 44-54 with a total of 245 (132 male and 113 female), under 25 had the second lowest number of employee with a total number of 97 (60 male and 37 female), while the least number of employee was recorded for over 55 age group with a total of 69 (44 male and 25 female).
The company consist of 882 male gender in total which makes up 60% of the total employee while a total of 588 female gender makes up the remaining 40%.

Job satisfaction rating
For this problem statement, a matrix chart was used.
Job satisfaction parameters (1=low, 2= medium, 3= high, 4=very high). 9 job roles (healthcare representative, human resources, manager, laboratory technician, manufacturing director, research director, research scientist, sales executive and sales representative) were compared against the job satisfaction rating by employees. The result indicated that Sales executive had the highest job satisfaction rating, while human resources had the least job satisfaction rating.

Education field by attrition
This addresses the number of employees leaving the company according to their education fields. Education fields namely: (Life sciences, medical, technical, marketing, others and human resources). A stacked bar chart was used. The result indicated that Life sciences had the highest attrition by education fields having a total of 89, followed by medical with a total of 63, marketing 35, technical 32, other 11 and the least was recorded for human resources. 

Attrition rate by gender for different age groups
This analysis evaluates how both genders are leaving the company in relation to their age group which was calculated earlier. 5 different age group (under 25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, over 55).
For under 25 age group, a total of 38 attrition count with 20 male (52.63%) and 18 females (47.37%) was recorded.
For 25-34 age group, a total of 112 attrition count with 69 male (61.61%) and 43 females (38.39%) was recorded.
For 35-44 age group, a total of 51 attrition count with 37 male (72.55%) and 14 females (27.45%) was recorded.
For 45-54 age group, a total of 25 attrition count with 16 male (64%) and 9 females (36%) was recorded.
For over 55 age group, a total of 51 attrition count with 37 male (72.55%) and 14 females (27.45%) was recorded.
Doughnut chart was used for this analysis.

**Conclusion**
 	A total of 1470 employees, attrition (employees out of the company) of 237, attrition rate of 16.12%, active employees of 1233 and an average age of 37.
 	R&D department had the highest attrition rate.
 	The age group of 25-34 had the highest number of employees in relation to other age group.
 	Sales executive recorded the highest job satisfaction rating while human resources had the least.
 	Life sciences recorded the peak attrition rate in relation to education field.
 	In relation to gender, a total of 150 males (63.29%), and 87 females (36.71%) left the company. Also, 25-34 age group had the        highest attrition rate.
 	This result call for immediate action to look into why R&D department had the highest number of attrition rate (56.12%) dominating more than half out of the 3 departments. This may be caused by several factors such as: Head of department personality, work routine of the department, work life balance, income amongst others.
